          <h2>Crewing Shows</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              Crewing shows involve a lot of people in various positions and
              jobs. The following is a list of what we need and what they
              entail, which anyone new could easily slide into doing:
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              <strong>CAMERA OPERATOR</strong>
              <br />
              As the name suggests, camera ops operate the cameras. After being
              trained how to use a camera, you can crew all of our shows as they
              will always need camera ops! If you enjoy filming and getting good
              shots, sometimes with a director in your ear, this job is for you.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>DIRECTOR</strong>
              <br />
              The director leads the show, making sure everyone is doing
              everything they need to be doing at the right time. They're in
              charge of ensuring all members of the team do their job!
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>FLOOR MANAGER</strong>
              <br />
              Floor manager makes sure that everyone and everything is running
              smoothly and gives support to the director.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>GRAPHICS OPERATOR</strong>
              <br />
              The graphics that appear on screen are controlled by the graphics
              op.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>RUNNER</strong>
              <br />
              Runners do a lot of running around! Whatever the director or
              anyone else wants, the runner does to ensure an effective and
              smooth show.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>SOUND OPERATOR</strong>
              <br />
              After being trained how to use the sound desk, the sound operator
              ensures that sound during shows is running without a hitch.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>VISION MIXER</strong>
              <br />
              Ever wondered who chooses between which camera shots get to be on
              telly? That's the vision mixer's job. Although it looks like
              you're merely pressing buttons, it's one of the most popular
              jobs!&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>VT OPERATOR&nbsp;</strong>
              <br />
              VT stands for 'video tape', in other words pre-filmed and edited
              footage made specifically for programmes. A VT operator is needed
              to ensure that VTs appear on screen during live shows.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>PRESENTING</strong>
              <br />
              Think you’ve got a face for television? Or always wanted to try
              out your Paxman impression on camera? Whatever your presenting
              ambition, we want to hear from you! We run presenting workshops,
              and give one on one advice to wannabe presenters. Just get in
              touch with our Production Director, who can advise you further.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>PRODUCING</strong>
              <br />
              The Production Team is always on the lookout for new ideas and
              budding producers. If you're interested in getting involved with
              the creation and running of our programmes, we want you working on
              our Team! New members wishing to become a permanent part of the
              Production Team are always welcome. We are a flexible, friendly
              and enthusiastic group of people passionate about TV production,
              and if you have something to offer us, or want to find out more
              about what we do, we would love to have you.
              <br />
              Despite the fanciness of the word 'production', it is in essence
              another way of saying 'creating and organising a show'. Production
              involves a plethora of things to do and skills to learn or build
              upon, and is without a doubt one of the best and easiest ways to
              get involved at YSTV. If you love to organise, delegate, lead,
              create and inspire, then production is for you. From finding the
              concept for a new show, to bringing the right people together to
              make it happen, to learning how to operate a camera and edit
              footage, production is hands-on, extremely fun, and open to anyone
              willing to put in the time. Even if you don't have a specific idea
              for a show, talk to us! There's something for everyone, and you
              will have the time of your life!
